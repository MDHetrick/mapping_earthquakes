# Mapping Earthquakes
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a variety of maps to visualize multiple sets of earthquake data as well as tectonic plate data.

## Maps
#### Tectonic Plate Data
Tectonic plate boundaries were added as an overlay. For better visibility, the boundary lines were changed to an orange-red color with a weight of 4.

#### Major Earthquake Data
Major earthquakes for the past 7 days were added as an overlay. For better visibility, the points were styled as described below.
- Earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6 were styled with a red color marker with a radius of the magnitude * 11.
- Earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5 were styled with a dark orange color marker with a radius of the magnitude * 8.
- Earthquakes with magnitudes less than and equal to 5 were styled with an orange color marker with a radius of the magnitude * 5.

#### Additional Maps
Two additional base layers were added. The outdoors style was added, as was the night navigation style.
